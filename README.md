# BIGNUM-WITH-KARATSUBA
This library implements a custom Big Integer class in C++ using the Karatsuba multiplication algorithm, a divide-and-conquer approach capable of multiplying extremely large numbers with 100% accuracy. It handles numbers far exceeding the limits of standard C++ data types, utilizing efficient storage through the string class. The library supports fundamental operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division along with logical operations such as <, >, ==, etc..

Key Features:

  Karatsuba Algorithm: High-performance multiplication for numbers of any size up to hardward-specific string length limits.
  Object-Oriented Design: Modular and extensible design using OOP principles.
  Operator Overloading: Arithmetic and logical operators are overloaded for seamless integration with standard C++ syntax.
  Custom Algorithms: Specialized algorithms for handling large numbers and precise arithmetic operations.
  
This library is ideal for anyone needing precise, large-scale integer arithmetic in C++ applications.
